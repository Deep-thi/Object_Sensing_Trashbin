# Object Sensing Trashbin
An entirely automated trashbin which detects an object near it and automatically opens the lid for waste disposal and closes it after a fixed amount of time. 

**Working:**</br>
The ultrasonic sensor is placed in front of the trashbin and when the sensor detects an object near it, it triggers the arduino to open the lid. The lid is opened with the help of servo motor which is activated by arduino. After a certain time(programmed in arduino), the lid is automatically closed.

**Hardware Used:**
* Arduino UNO
* Ultrasonic sensor
* Servo motor
* Battery for power supply
* Connecting wires
